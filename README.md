# Getting Started with NEXT

This is a not so fancy store front. Still, if you want to try it, you can find it in the following link.

## Mini storefront's link
* Once you click in the link you should wait 2 or 3 seconds until the data is loaded
* Should you have any inconvenience, please let me know.
* [Link to site](https://store-with-nextjs.vercel.app/)

## Project's Goals
- Build a Mini Store using **React, Nextjs, JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap**.
- Use the latest version of **Next** and its features.

## Statement
- The DB is populated using static information.
- React Context and useContext is used to feed components with the **state** and useful **functions**

## Technologies used:
- [ ] React
- [ ] Next
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Bootstrap
 
## How it works
* Clone this repository,
* Run **npm install**,
* Run **npm build**,
* Run **npm start**,
* Whait until **http://localhost:3000** shows up and use **Ctrl + mouse pointer + left mouse button** to open it in your browser.
